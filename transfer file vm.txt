Title-

Find a procedure to transfer the files from one virtual
machine to another virtual machine

Steps-

Download and install Oracle's Virtual Box-
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

Download Ubuntu VMDK Image-

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sJ1llAWL8KlpNZfCZR26sjaILp6n0BrD/view?usp=sharing

Launch Virtualbox and create a new VM

Click on new and mention the Name and the machine
folder along with the Type and Version of the Machine to
be created.

Assign memory size for our VM (1024 MB sufficient for
now).

Select the option Use an existing virtual hard disk file
and locate the downloaded VMDK image and create VM

Now we have to create a NAT Network so go to File ->
Preferences -> Network -> Add a New NAT Network
(Click on +)

Right click and edit the Network name and CIDR if
needed.

Repeat the process of launching the VM for 2 instances

Now go to the setting, go to the network setting and change the
adapter to NAT Network and select the NAT Network you made

Launch the VM now

Install the net-tools to know the IP's of the instance

create a file and write something into it

If your file is on the VM with IP **172.168.2.4** and the second
VM's IP is **172.168.2.5**.

Transfer the file using **SCP**

$ scp tranfer.txt vagrant@172.168.2.5:/home/vagrant

Check for the file in the Second VM under the **/home/vagrant**
directory
